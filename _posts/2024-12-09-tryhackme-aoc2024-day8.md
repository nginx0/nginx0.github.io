Glitch, a skilled but mistrusted hacker, was prepping for a tech conference. He was eager to share his shellcode script that remotely accessed his home system. As he worked, he noticed Mayor Malware's henchmen lurking nearby.

<i>"They're wasting their time. I don't have anything they'd want,"</i> Glitch chuckled.
